# Furhat_Actor_Theater

Skill developed for the assesment of Pablo Rodrigo by Furhat Robotics on 29/03/2019. 

In this skill, Furhat has the ability to play different roles in the same performance 
(could easily be adapted to perform multiple roles on multiple performances) depending 
on the user choice.

Its main aim is to train other actors, it encorages perfection and is a great motivational
tool for the user. Furhat is the perfect robot for this application due to its remarkable 
adaptability to play realistically very different roles.
